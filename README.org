* Stump config

This is my stumpwm config. At the moment it is quite immature
* Dependencies
There isn't many extra dependencies aside from =stumpwm= and
=stumpwm-contribute=. However I do use my standard library in places

- _By hand_

  + Grab the library from https://github.com/mariari/Misc-Lisp-Scripts
  + Run in your your auto loaded file (=.sbclrc=) or =init.lisp=
    #+begin_src lisp
      (load "path to asd")
      (ql:quickload :misc)
      ;; After the first time, this can be replaced with
      (asdf:load-system :misc)
    #+end_src

- _Via ros_
  + =ros install mariari/Misc-Lisp-Scripts=
  + Should just work, however you may need to run
    =(ql:quickload :misc)= once.

The ros method requires having your stumpwm work via roswell, which
isn't standard
